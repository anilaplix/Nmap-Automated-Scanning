# Nmap Automated Scanning
 Python script to automate NMAP scans

Important: Ensure you have the Nmap module installed on your machine. For Windows, the command is “pip install python-nmap" or “pip3 install python-nmap" for python 3 

The first thing to do is to make sure the text document is in the correct location. The correct location will have to be the location of the python script. Ensure that the file is named “ip_list.txt” if not the script will send an error message specifying the error. 

In the actual Python script, there is a section that should be changed unless you also have an F: drive. 
Should be named "#Specify the destination directory for exported files"
